Current nuclear reactors employed in the United States use \gls{LEU} fuel  
enriched to no more than 5\%. New reactor designs, such as the \gls{USNC} 
\gls{MMR}\textsuperscript{TM}, will require \gls{HALEU} fuel enriched 
between 5-20\%. To meet \gls{HALEU} fuel requirements, the U.S. Department 
of Energy is considering recovery and downblending of \gls{HEU} fuel and 
enriching natural uranium to the required levels \cite{griffith_overview_2020}, 
with each of these methods containing their own limitations. Recovery and 
downblending of \gls{HEU} fuel is limited by the existing physical supply 
of \gls{HEU} as well as downblending capacity. 
Enrichment of natural uranium is limited by centrifuge capacity, in 
terms of \gls{SWU}. This work aims to quantify the resource requirements of the current 
U.S. reactor fleet and of the transition to different reactors that require 
\gls{HALEU} fuel. 

The fuel cycle scenarios are modeled using \Cyclus, an 
agent-based fuel cycle simulator \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. The scenarios 
model the current U.S. fuel cycle, with each reactor unit modeled as a 
separate agent, from 1965 to 2090. The \gls{IAEA} \gls{PRIS} database 
\cite{noauthor_power_1989} provided information about each reactor. 
The first scenario modeled does not include the transition to an advanced 
reactor, and is used to provide a baseline of resources required. The next 
scenarios modeled include the transition to either the \gls{USNC} 
\gls{MMR}\textsuperscript{TM}\cite{mitchell_usnc_2020} or the X-energy 
Xe-100\textsuperscript{TM} reactor\cite{hussain_advances_2018}
and model either a no-growth or 1\% growth scenario. This creates five 
different scenarios. The transition scenarios were selected to provide 
comparison between advanced reactors with long cycle times and online 
refueling. 

The results of this work includes the rate of reactor deployment, the mass
of enriched uranium, and the \gls{SWU} capacity required for each 
scenario. These metrics inform the material requirements and provide insight 
into the best method to meet fuel requirements for these transition 
scenarios.
