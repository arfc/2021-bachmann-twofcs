    \frametitle{Conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simulated 5 fuel cycle scenarios to investigate the material 
              requirements of deploying \gls{HALEU}-fueled reactors
        \item Transitions to the X-energy Xe-100 reactor are better able to meet 
              the energy demand of the scenarios
        \item Transitions to the \gls{USNC} \gls{MMR}\textsuperscript{TM}
              have significantly more material requirements than transitions to 
              the X-energy Xe-100
        \item Changing to a 1\% growth demand model requires 
              advanced reactors to be deployed 2 years earlier
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Ongoing Work}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Incorporate \gls{LWR} license expiration dates
            \item Increase the amount of time in the scenario, change end date to 2125
            \item Determine how much \gls{HALEU} can be produced by downblending \gls{HEU}
        \end{itemize}
