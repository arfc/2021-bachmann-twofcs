    \frametitle{Conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simulated 5 fuel cycle scenarios to investigate the material 
              requirements of deploying \gls{HALEU}-fueled reactors
        \item Transitions to the X-energy Xe-100 reactor are better able to meet 
              the energy demand of the scenarios due to longer lifetimes
        \item Transitions to the \gls{USNC} \gls{MMR}
              have significantly more material requirements than transitions to 
              the X-energy Xe-100
        \item Changing to a 1\% growth demand model requires 
              advanced reactors to be deployed 2.5 years earlier
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Ongoing Work}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Incorporate \gls{LWR} license expiration dates
            \item Increase the amount of time in the scenario, change end date to 2125 to include 
                  replacement of X-energy Xe-100 reactors
            \item Determine how much \gls{HEU} is needed to produce the required \gls{HALEU} for 
                  each scenario
        \end{itemize}
